<!-- ========== ABOUT ========== -->

<div class="docs-section">

  <h4>About</h4>

  <p>
  I am currently a posdoc at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT CSAIL</a>, 
  working with <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon/" target="_blank"> Justin Solomon</a> and <a href="  https://healthyml.org/marzyeh/" target="_blank"> Marzyeh Ghassemi</a>.
  I obtaiend my Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon Univeristy, as well as an M.S. in Machine Learning. 
  I am fourtunate to have Prof. <a href="https://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~xuanlong/" target="_blank">Long Nguyen</a> to be my academia advisor, 
  and I work closely with Prof. <a href="https://aisecure.github.io/" target="_blank">Bo Li</a>. 
  My research has been supported by the <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship/2022-north-america" target="_blank">Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship (QIF 2022)</a>.
  Previously, I received my bachelor's in Computational Mechanics and a minor in Data Science from Fudan University.

 </p><p>
  
  My research focuses on developing <b>generalizable machine learning methods</b>, 
  to ensure  <b>AI/ML in healthcare are trustworthy</b> and can benefit <b>large and diverse populations equitably</b>.
  
  I extract insights from Bayesian statistics, probabilistic modeling, and particularly optimal transport, 
  to investigate the underlying geometric structures within both data and models. 
  Recently, my studies have pivoted towards exploring self-supervised learning and fine-tuning approaches for foundational models

  <!-- <UL style="margin:1px;padding:0px;">
    <li> Optimal transport distances in structured domains </li>
    <li> Principled and robust interpretable machine learning (for structured data, and beyond) </li>
  </UL> -->

  <!-- </p><p>
  My approach to the first of these goals draws on ideas from statistics, optimization, and applied mathematics, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_theory_(mathematics)" target="_blank">optimal transport</a>, which I have used to develop methods to mitigate data scarcity by various types of geometric dataset manipulations: <a href="#InvarOT">alignment</a>, <a href="#OTDD">comparison</a>, <a href="#GWGAN">generation</a>, and <a href="#OTGF">transformation</a>.
  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/directions-in-ml-automating-dataset-comparison-and-manipulation-with-optimal-transport/">This talk</a> provides a high-level overview of this part of my work.
  </p><p> -->
  <!-- As for trustworthy machine learning, I have worked on methods for explaining predictions of <a href="#interpseq">black box models</a>, showed their <a href="#Robust-interpret">lack of robustness</a>, proposed methods to <a href="#SENN">robustify them</a>, and sought inspiration in the social sciences to make them <a href="WOE-HCML">human-centered</a>.

<!-- <span class="anchor" id="bio"></span>
<div class="docs-section">
  <h4>Bio</h4>
  <p> I obtained a PhD in computer science from MIT, where I worked at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">CSAIL</a>  on
    various topics in machine learning 

  <p> During my PhD, I interned twice at Microsoft Research (once at the Redmond Lab, once at the New York Lab), during which I was fortunate to 
    collaborate with a stellar group of mentors: Scott Yih, Ming-Wei Chang, Kristina Toutanova, Chris Meek, Hanna Wallach, 
    Jenn Wortman Vaughan and Hal Daumé III. </p>

Specifically, (1) we augment the data by finding the worst-case Wasserstein barycenter on the geodesic connecting subpopulation distributions. (2) we regularize the model for smoother performance on the continuous geodesic path connecting subpopulation distributions. (3) Additionally, we provide a theoretical guarantee of robustness improvement and investigate how the geodesic location and the sample size contribute, respectively. Experimental validations of the proposed strategy on four datasets including CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, establish the efficacy of our method, e.g., our method improves the baselines’ certifiable robustness on CIFAR10 upto 7.7%, with 16.8% on empirical robustness on CIFAR-100. Our work provides a new perspective of model robustness through the lens of Wasserstein geodesic-based interpolation with a practical off-the-shelf strategy that can be combined with existing robust training methods.}

The current paradigms with machine learning methods are often limited by the amount of labeled data. This phenomenon is particularly problematic for clinically-relevant data, where labeling at scale can be time-consuming and costly in terms of the specialized expertise and human effort required. Moreover, deep learning classifiers may be vulnerable to adversarial examples and perturbations, which could have catastrophic consequences, for example, when applied in the context of medical treatment, clinical trials, or insurance claims. In this paper, we propose a physiologically-inspired data augmentation method to improve performance and increase the robustness of heart disease detection based on ECG signals. We obtain augmented samples by perturbing the data distribution towards other classes along the geodesic in Wasserstein space. To better utilize domain-specific knowledge, we design a ground metric that recognizes the difference between ECG signals based on physiologically determined features. Learning from 12-lead ECG signals, our model is able to distinguish five categories of cardiac conditions. Our results demonstrate improvements in accuracy and robustness, reflecting the effectiveness of our data augmentation method.}

                        abstract = 	 {Heart rate variability (HRV) is a practical and noninvasive measure of autonomic nervous system activity, which plays an essential role in cardiovascular health. However, using HRV to assess physiology status is challenging. Even in clinical settings, HRV is sensitive to acute stressors such as physical activity, mental stress, hydration, alcohol, and sleep. Wearable devices provide convenient HRV measurements, but the irregularity of measurements and uncaptured stressors can bias conventional analytical methods. To better interpret HRV measurements for downstream healthcare applications, we learn a personalized diurnal rhythm as an accurate physiological indicator for each individual. We develop Physiological Multitask-Learning (PhysioMTL) by harnessing Optimal Transport theory within a Multitask-learning (MTL) framework. The proposed method learns an individual-specific predictive model from heterogeneous observations, and enables estimation of an optimal transport map that yields a push forward operation onto the demographic features for each task. Our model outperforms competing MTL methodologies on unobserved predictive tasks for synthetic and two real-world datasets. Specifically, our method provides remarkable prediction results on unseen held-out subjects given only $20%$ of the subjects in real-world observational studies. Furthermore, our model enables a counterfactual engine that generates the effect of acute stressors and chronic conditions on HRV rhythms.}

Specifically, (1) we augment the data by finding the worst-case Wasserstein barycenter on the geodesic connecting subpopulation distributions. (2) we regularize the model for smoother performance on the continuous geodesic path connecting subpopulation distributions. (3) Additionally, we provide a theoretical guarantee of robustness improvement and investigate how the geodesic location and the sample size contribute, respectively. Experimental validations of the proposed strategy on four datasets including CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, establish the efficacy of our method, e.g., our method improves the baselines’ certifiable robustness on CIFAR10 upto 7.7%, with 16.8% on empirical robustness on CIFAR-100. Our work provides a new perspective of model robustness through the lens of Wasserstein geodesic-based interpolation with a practical off-the-shelf strategy that can be combined with existing robust training methods.}

The current paradigms with machine learning methods are often limited by the amount of labeled data. This phenomenon is particularly problematic for clinically-relevant data, where labeling at scale can be time-consuming and costly in terms of the specialized expertise and human effort required. Moreover, deep learning classifiers may be vulnerable to adversarial examples and perturbations, which could have catastrophic consequences, for example, when applied in the context of medical treatment, clinical trials, or insurance claims. In this paper, we propose a physiologically-inspired data augmentation method to improve performance and increase the robustness of heart disease detection based on ECG signals. We obtain augmented samples by perturbing the data distribution towards other classes along the geodesic in Wasserstein space. To better utilize domain-specific knowledge, we design a ground metric that recognizes the difference between ECG signals based on physiologically determined features. Learning from 12-lead ECG signals, our model is able to distinguish five categories of cardiac conditions. Our results demonstrate improvements in accuracy and robustness, reflecting the effectiveness of our data augmentation method.}

However, using HRV to assess physiology status is challenging. Even in clinical settings, HRV is sensitive to acute stressors such as physical activity, mental stress, hydration, alcohol, and sleep. Wearable devices provide convenient HRV measurements, but the irregularity of measurements and uncaptured stressors can bias conventional analytical methods. To better interpret HRV measurements for downstream healthcare applications, we learn a personalized diurnal rhythm as an accurate physiological indicator for each individual. We develop Physiological Multitask-Learning (PhysioMTL) by harnessing Optimal Transport theory within a Multitask-learning (MTL) framework. The proposed method learns an individual-specific predictive model from heterogeneous observations, and enables estimation of an optimal transport map that yields a push forward operation onto the demographic features for each task. Our model outperforms competing MTL methodologies on unobserved predictive tasks for synthetic and two real-world datasets. Specifically, our method provides remarkable prediction results on unseen held-out subjects given only $20%$ of the subjects in real-world observational studies. Furthermore, our model enables a counterfactual engine that generates the effect of acute stressors and chronic conditions on HRV rhythms.}

The current paradigms with machine learning methods are often limited by the amount of labeled data. This phenomenon is particularly problematic for clinically-relevant data, where labeling at scale can be time-consuming and costly in terms of the specialized expertise and human effort required. Moreover, deep learning classifiers may be vulnerable to adversarial examples and perturbations, which could have catastrophic consequences, for example, when applied in the context of medical treatment, clinical trials, or insurance claims. In this paper, we propose a physiologically-inspired data augmentation method to improve performance and increase the robustness of heart disease detection based on ECG signals. We obtain augmented samples by perturbing the data distribution towards other classes along the geodesic in Wasserstein space. To better utilize domain-specific knowledge, we design a ground metric that recognizes the difference between ECG signals based on physiologically determined features. Learning from 12-lead ECG signals, our model is able to distinguish five categories of cardiac conditions. Our results demonstrate improvements in accuracy and robustness, reflecting the effectiveness of our data augmentation method.}

                    abstract = 	 {Heart rate variability (HRV) is a practical and noninvasive measure of autonomic nervous system activity, which plays an essential role in cardiovascular health. However, using HRV to assess physiology status is challenging. Even in clinical settings, HRV is sensitive to acute stressors such as physical activity, mental stress, hydration, alcohol, and sleep. Wearable devices provide convenient HRV measurements, but the irregularity of measurements and uncaptured stressors can bias conventional analytical methods. To better interpret HRV measurements for downstream healthcare applications, we learn a personalized diurnal rhythm as an accurate physiological indicator for each individual. We develop Physiological Multitask-Learning (PhysioMTL) by harnessing Optimal Transport theory within a Multitask-learning (MTL) framework. The proposed method learns an individual-specific predictive model from heterogeneous observations, and enables estimation of an optimal transport map that yields a push forward operation onto the demographic features for each task. Our model outperforms competing MTL methodologies on unobserved predictive tasks for synthetic and two real-world datasets. Specifically, our method provides remarkable prediction results on unseen held-out subjects given only $20%$ of the subjects in real-world observational studies. Furthermore, our model enables a counterfactual engine that generates the effect of acute stressors and chronic conditions on HRV rhythms.}

                    abstract = 	 {A vast literature shows that the learning-based visual perception model is sensitive to adversarial noises, but few works consider the robustness of robotic perception models under widely-existing camera motion perturbations. To this end, we study the robustness of the visual perception model under camera motion perturbations to investigate the influence of camera motion on robotic perception. Specifically, we propose a motion smoothing technique for arbitrary image classification models, whose robustness under camera motion perturbations could be certified. The proposed robustness certification framework based on camera motion smoothing provides effective and scalable robustness guarantees for visual perception modules so that they are applicable to wide robotic applications. As far as we are aware, this is the first work to provide robustness certification for the deep perception module against camera motions, which improves the trustworthiness of robotic perception. A realistic indoor robotic dataset with a dense point cloud map for the entire room, MetaRoom, is introduced for the challenging certifiable robust perception task. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the certification approach via motion smoothing against camera motion perturbations. Our framework guarantees the certified accuracy of 81.7% against camera translation perturbation along depth direction within -0.1m &nbsp; 0.1m. We also validate the effectiveness of our method on the real-world robot by conducting hardware experiments on the robotic arm with an eye-in-hand camera. The code is available at https://github.com/HanjiangHu/camera-motion-smoothing.}

It plays an essential role in real-world applications, i.e., automatically generating cover images and titles for news articles or providing introductions to online videos. However, existing methods extract features from the whole video and article and use fusion methods to select the representative one, thus usually ignoring the critical structure and varying semantics with video/document. In this work, we propose a Semantics-Consistent Cross-domain Summarization (SCCS) model based on optimal transport alignment with visual and textual segmentation. Our method first decomposes both videos and articles into segments in order to capture the structural semantics, and then follows a cross-domain alignment objective with optimal transport distance, which leverages multimodal interaction to match and select the visual and textual summary. We evaluated our method on three MSMO datasets, and achieved performance improvement by 8{\%} {\&} 6{\%} of textual and 6.6{\%} {\&}5.7{\%} of video summarization, respectively, which demonstrated the effectiveness of our method in producing high-quality multimodal summaries.",

Specifically, (1) we augment the data by finding the worst-case Wasserstein barycenter on the geodesic connecting subpopulation distributions. (2) we regularize the model for smoother performance on the continuous geodesic path connecting subpopulation distributions. (3) Additionally, we provide a theoretical guarantee of robustness improvement and investigate how the geodesic location and the sample size contribute, respectively. Experimental validations of the proposed strategy on four datasets including CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, establish the efficacy of our method, e.g., our method improves the baselines’ certifiable robustness on CIFAR10 upto 7.7%, with 16.8% on empirical robustness on CIFAR-100. Our work provides a new perspective of model robustness through the lens of Wasserstein geodesic-based interpolation with a practical off-the-shelf strategy that can be combined with existing robust training methods.}

The current paradigms with machine learning methods are often limited by the amount of labeled data. This phenomenon is particularly problematic for clinically-relevant data, where labeling at scale can be time-consuming and costly in terms of the specialized expertise and human effort required. Moreover, deep learning classifiers may be vulnerable to adversarial examples and perturbations, which could have catastrophic consequences, for example, when applied in the context of medical treatment, clinical trials, or insurance claims. In this paper, we propose a physiologically-inspired data augmentation method to improve performance and increase the robustness of heart disease detection based on ECG signals. We obtain augmented samples by perturbing the data distribution towards other classes along the geodesic in Wasserstein space. To better utilize domain-specific knowledge, we design a ground metric that recognizes the difference between ECG signals based on physiologically determined features. Learning from 12-lead ECG signals, our model is able to distinguish five categories of cardiac conditions. Our results demonstrate improvements in accuracy and robustness, reflecting the effectiveness of our data augmentation method.}

However, using HRV to assess physiology status is challenging. Even in clinical settings, HRV is sensitive to acute stressors such as physical activity, mental stress, hydration, alcohol, and sleep. Wearable devices provide convenient HRV measurements, but the irregularity of measurements and uncaptured stressors can bias conventional analytical methods. To better interpret HRV measurements for downstream healthcare applications, we learn a personalized diurnal rhythm as an accurate physiological indicator for each individual. We develop Physiological Multitask-Learning (PhysioMTL) by harnessing Optimal Transport theory within a Multitask-learning (MTL) framework. The proposed method learns an individual-specific predictive model from heterogeneous observations, and enables estimation of an optimal transport map that yields a push forward operation onto the demographic features for each task. Our model outperforms competing MTL methodologies on unobserved predictive tasks for synthetic and two real-world datasets. Specifically, our method provides remarkable prediction results on unseen held-out subjects given only $20%$ of the subjects in real-world observational studies. Furthermore, our model enables a counterfactual engine that generates the effect of acute stressors and chronic conditions on HRV rhythms.}

                    abstract = 	 {A vast literature shows that the learning-based visual perception model is sensitive to adversarial noises, but few works consider the robustness of robotic perception models under widely-existing camera motion perturbations. To this end, we study the robustness of the visual perception model under camera motion perturbations to investigate the influence of camera motion on robotic perception. Specifically, we propose a motion smoothing technique for arbitrary image classification models, whose robustness under camera motion perturbations could be certified. The proposed robustness certification framework based on camera motion smoothing provides effective and scalable robustness guarantees for visual perception modules so that they are applicable to wide robotic applications. As far as we are aware, this is the first work to provide robustness certification for the deep perception module against camera motions, which improves the trustworthiness of robotic perception. A realistic indoor robotic dataset with a dense point cloud map for the entire room, MetaRoom, is introduced for the challenging certifiable robust perception task. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the certification approach via motion smoothing against camera motion perturbations. Our framework guarantees the certified accuracy of 81.7% against camera translation perturbation along depth direction within -0.1m &nbsp; 0.1m. We also validate the effectiveness of our method on the real-world robot by conducting hardware experiments on the robotic arm with an eye-in-hand camera. The code is available at https://github.com/HanjiangHu/camera-motion-smoothing.}
